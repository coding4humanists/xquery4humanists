## Welcome!

Welcome to the companion website for _XQuery for Humanists_, written by [Clifford B. Anderson](https://www.cliffordanderson.net/) and [Joseph C. Wicentowski](https://joewiz.org) and published by Texas A&M University Press in 2020. This website offers supplementary material for readers of the book and those interested in its contents:

- An online and downloadable set of [the code](code/) listed in the book.
- Extensive information about the four [XQuery implementations](implementations/) introduced in the book, including each their built-in facilities for browsing [function documentation](functions/).
- A list of [errata](errata/) discovered after the book went to press.
- The full [table of contents](#table-of-contents).

## About the Book

XQuery is the best language for querying, manipulating, and transforming XML and JSON documents. Because XML is in many ways the lingua franca of the digital humanities, learning XQuery empowers humanists to discover and analyze their data in new ways.

Until now, though, XQuery has been difficult to learn because there was no textbook designed for non-programmers or beginner programmers. _XQuery for Humanists_ fills this void with an approachable guidebook aimed directly at digital humanists.

Clifford B. Anderson and Joseph C. Wicentowski introduce XQuery in terms accessible to humanities scholars and do not presuppose any prior background in programming. It provides an informed, opinionated overview and recommends the best implementations, libraries, and paradigms to empower those who need it most. Emphasizing practical applicability, the authors go beyond the XQuery language to include the basics of underlying standards like XPath, related standards like XQuery Full Text and XQuery Update, and explain the difference between XQuery and languages like Python and R. This book will afford readers the skills they need to build and analyze large-scale documentary corpora in XML. 

_XQuery for Humanists_ is immeasurably valuable to instructors of digital humanities and library science courses alike and likewise is a ready reference for faculty, graduate students, and librarians who seek to master XQuery for their projects.
