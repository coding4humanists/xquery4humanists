This document discusses the four XQuery implementations discussed in the book: [BaseX](#basex), [eXist](#exist), [Saxon](#saxon), and [oXygen XML Editor](#oxygen-xml-editor). It lists key links, describes support for the XQuery specifications, and provides chapter-specific notes.

## BaseX

### XQuery coverage in BaseX

BaseX has posted full notes on its [conformance with XQuery 3.1 and related standards](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/XQuery). The following information is current as of BaseX 9.3.1.

- BaseX supports all of XQuery 3.1 Functions and Operators, except for the following (note that all functions covered in the book have alternatives listed):
    - `fn:collation-key()`
    - `fn:load-xquery-module()` 
    - `fn:transform()` (use BaseX's [`xslt:transform()`](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/XSLT) function)

### Chapter-specific notes for BaseX

- Chapter 9
    - `fn:put()` writes documents to "secondary storage". See BaseX's documentation for [discussion](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/XQuery_Update#Built-in_Functions) of this function and a link to "Additional database functions exist for performing updates on document and database level."

### XQuery coverage in eXist

eXist has posted full notes on its [conformance with XQuery 3.1 and related standards](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/xquery#current-status-of-xquery-support). The following list is current as of eXist v6.2.0.

- eXist has implemented all of XQuery 3.1, except:
    - Count clause (introduced in Chapter 7; pre-sorting results and using the `at` clause can generally be substituted)
    - Windowing (introduced in Chapter 7)
- eXist has not implemented the following related specifications:
    - XQuery Update Facility 3.0 (introduced in Chapter 9). Instead, it provides [an eXist-specific update facility](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/update_ext.xml).
    - XPath and XQuery Full Text 3.0 (introduced in Chapter 10). Instead, it provides [a full text search module](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/lucene.xml) based on Apache Lucene.

### Chapter-specific notes for eXist

- Chapter 9
    - eXist does not support the XQuery Update Facility 3.0. Instead, use the [eXist-specific update facility](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/update_ext.xml), which can perform all of the same functions.
    - As a substitute for the `fn:put()` function, introduced in XQuery Update Facility 3.0, use [`xmldb:store()`](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/fundocs/view.html?uri=http://exist-db.org/xquery/xmldb#store.3) to store documents or resources in the database or [`file:serialize()`](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/fundocs/view.html?uri=http://exist-db.org/xquery/file#serialize.3) to store XML documents on the file system. (See also [`file:serialize-binary()`](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/fundocs/view.html?uri=http://exist-db.org/xquery/file#serialize-binary.2) to store non-XML resources to the file system.)
    - eXist does not require the `%updating` annotation to be added to functions that contain updating expressions. Nor does it require the `%simple` annotation to be added to non-updating functions.
- Chapter 10
    - eXist does not support the XPath and XQuery Full Text Facility 3.0 (introduced in Chapter 10). Instead, it provides [a full text search module](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/lucene.xml) based on Apache Lucene, which can perform many of the same functions, as well as other functions not provided by the XQuery Full Text Facility.

## Saxon

Saxon is oXygen's default, built-in XQuery engine. It can also be called via the command line.

### XQuery coverage in Saxon

Saxon has posted full notes on its [conformance with XQuery 3.1 and related standards](http://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/conformance/xquery31.html).

- Saxon supports the full XQuery 3.1 Functions and Operators specification.
- Saxon has not implemented the following related specifications:
    - XQuery Update Facility 3.0 (introduced in Chapter 9), but implements XQuery Update Facility 1.0 as extensions to the XQuery 3.1 grammar. 
    - XQuery Full Text Facility 3.0 (introduced in Chapter 10). Saxon provides no full text search facility.
- The different editions of Saxon implement different levels of XQuery 3.1:
    - Saxon-HE (the free, open source edition) implements XQuery 3.1 at the Minimal Conformance level, plus the Module Feature and the Serialization Feature.
    - Saxon-PE (commercial, included in oXygen) adds support for the Higher-Order Function Feature.
    - Saxon-EE (commercial, included in oXygen) adds support for the Schema Aware Feature and the Typed Data Feature.

### Chapter-specific notes for Saxon

- Chapter 4
    - Saxon complains when serializing a free-standing attribute node (04-13, 04-15). As a workaround, add `/fn:string()` to the expression to retrieve the string value of the attribute.
- Chapter 5
    - oXygen 20.1 (which bundles Saxon 9.8.0.12) returns no results for 05-23, but Saxon 9.9.0.1 returns the expected result.
- Chapter 7
    - As noted in the note in the text, oXygen complains when serializing non-XML items like maps, arrays, or functions. Use the workaround noted in the text, the `fn:serialize()` function. (Also affects Chapter 12.)
    - When using functions in the `map` or `array` namespace, these namespaces must be declared in the prolog.
- Chapter 9
    - When running 09-05 in oXygen, must enable "linked tree model" in Preferences > Saxon HE/PE/EE Options. I was unable to get the `-tree:linked` flag to work when executing this query on the command line.
    - 09-11 thru 09-13 complains of "unexpected token name 'transform' beyond end of query
- Chapter 12
    - The `fn:json-to-xml()` function used in 12-07 fails when the "linked tree model" is enabled; the error is "missing call on startContent()"; disabling this allows the function to work

## oXygen XML Editor

- Forum: [oXygen Forums](https://www.oxygenxml.com/forum/)

### XQuery coverage in oXygen

- By default, oXygen is configured to use Saxon as its XQuery engine. For information on Saxon, see [above](#saxon).
- oXygen can also be [configured](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/eXist_support.html) to use eXist as its XQuery engine. This is configured via Preferences > XQuery > XML > XSLT-FO-XQuery > XQuery > Validation engine. For information on eXist, see [above](#exist).
